            Are you still stuck or have you spent several fustrating hours trying to configure your newly configured loading screen?<br /><br />
            
            Don't worry, many people have struggled to get it set up. If you're stuck or need help then simply get in contact with me by submitting a support ticket through
            ScriptFodder.<br /><br />
            
            I check my ScriptFodder Messages quite often so you will normally get a response within 24hours.<br /><br />
            
            When submitting your support ticket please be as detailed as possible as well as including a link to your where the loading screen is at (if you have already uploaded it that is). 
            This is so that I can provide you with support faster :)</p>
